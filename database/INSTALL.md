This is the Helm + Harvester `Addon` install path — what a real Rancher/Harvester administrator would use. [`README.md`](./README.md)'s Quickstart covers the older kustomize-based internal/team path instead; the two are independent, don't co-install both over the same resources.

## Prerequisites

Beyond README.md's base prerequisites (Harvester cluster, NAD, `kubectl`):

1. **Go + kubebuilder** (matching `PROJECT`'s `cliVersion`) — to (re)generate the chart.
2. **Helm 3.8+** and **Docker**, authenticated against your target registry (`docker login ghcr.io ...`; Helm 4 reuses Docker's cached OCI credentials automatically).
3. Write access to whatever GHCR namespace you're publishing under.

## Testing without WSO2 registry access

Until write access to the real `ghcr.io/wso2/...` namespace exists (the one open item in [Discussion #303](https://github.com/wso2/open-cloud-datacenter/discussions/303)'s "Clarifications requested"), every committed default (chart `values.yaml`, the Addon example manifest) stays generic/placeholder. Test against your own personal GHCR via overrides, never by editing those defaults:

- **Chart:** `helm upgrade --install dbaas-operator database/charts/chart --set manager.image.repository=ghcr.io/<you>/dbaas-operator --set manager.image.tag=<tag>`
- **Kustomize (`make deploy`):** `make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/<you>/dbaas-controller:<tag>` — mutates `config/manager/kustomization.yaml`; revert after: `git checkout -- config/manager/kustomization.yaml`.
- **Addon manifest:** copy `deploy/harvester-addon/dbaas-operator/dbaas-operator.yaml` to `dbaas-operator.local.yaml` (gitignored) and fill in your own values there. Never edit the committed one.

If a review needs your personal artifacts as evidence before real registry access exists, cite digests/commit — as Discussion #303's "What's already proven" does — rather than committing the personal reference.

## 1. Generate (or regenerate) the chart

```sh
cd database
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v2-alpha --output-dir=charts
```

- Lands at `database/charts/chart/` (the plugin appends its own `chart/` under `--output-dir`).
- This resets `config/manager/kustomization.yaml`'s image to the generic `controller:latest` (its internal `make build-installer` call) — harmless: that file is deliberately never a source of truth for a real image, matching README's own Quickstart, which always passes `IMG=` explicitly on every command. Don't commit a real registry value into it; there's nothing to protect from a regen.
- Only `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `NOTES.txt`, `_helpers.tpl`, `.helmignore`, and the test-chart workflow survive a re-run without `--force` — every other template regenerates from current `config/`, wiping any hand-fix (like step 2's RBAC fix) that isn't in this preserved list.

## 2. Fix the generated defaults (one-time per real change, not every regen)

- **`Chart.yaml`** is never auto-regenerated — set `name`/`description`/`version`/`appVersion` by hand. Keep the chart name consistent with `HELM_RELEASE` in `make helm-deploy`, or you get a double-barrelled `<release>-<chart>` resource prefix instead of a clean one.
- **`rbac.namespaced` toggle**: the plugin generates this on `manager-role.yaml`/`manager-rolebinding.yaml`/the three `dbinstance-*-role.yaml` files. **Remove it** — DBaaS reconciles `DBInstance`s across every tenant namespace, and the manager lists and watches cluster-wide (`cmd/main.go` sets no cache namespace), so with only a namespaced `Role` it hits `forbidden` errors and cannot start reconciling. Hardcode `ClusterRole`/`ClusterRoleBinding` in all five, drop `namespaced:` from `values.yaml`. Doesn't survive a bare regen — reapply after any template-affecting change.
  - **A single-namespace install (controller and `DBInstance`s in one namespace) is therefore not supported yet.** Supporting it needs two things together: the chart toggle, and an operator setting that restricts the manager's cache to the watched namespace (plus read access to the image and NAD namespaces). It would also put the controller-private Secrets (internal credentials, TLS keys) in the tenants' namespace, so it would suit testing only.
- **Image default**: point `values.yaml`'s `manager.image.repository`/`tag` at your real publish target — never the generic `controller`/`latest` placeholder, never a personal registry (see above).

## 3. Package the chart

```sh
helm package database/charts/chart --version <X.Y.Z>
# → dbaas-operator-<X.Y.Z>.tgz
```
Gitignored build output — never committed. For a real release it becomes a GitHub Release asset instead (see "Publishing a real release").

## 4. Build and push the controller image

```sh
cd database
docker build -t <registry>/dbaas-operator:<X.Y.Z> .
docker push <registry>/dbaas-operator:<X.Y.Z>
```
Use `docker build`/`push` directly, **not** `make docker-buildx` — its recipe lines are `-`-prefixed, so `make` silently ignores build/push failures instead of stopping on them.

If your build context is slow (Packer artifacts under `database/images/`, local binaries under `database/bin/` getting swept in), add a `database/.dockerignore`.

## 5. Push the chart as an OCI artifact

```sh
helm push dbaas-operator-<X.Y.Z>.tgz oci://<registry>/charts
```
No `helm repo add` needed — OCI charts are referenced directly by path + `--version`.

## 6. Make both GHCR packages public (or set a pull secret)

Both default to **Private**. For the Addon's install Job (runs with no credentials unless you configure `dockerRegistrySecret`) to pull anonymously: GitHub → profile → **Packages** → package → **Package settings** → **Danger Zone** → **Change visibility** → **Public**.

To keep them private instead, add `dockerRegistrySecret` (`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`) to the `Addon` manifest (step 8) — that field exists on the underlying `HelmChart` CRD for this.

## 7. Baked-image bootstrap (one-time per Harvester cluster, independent of the operator install)

**The operator never imports VM images itself** (`ResolveVMImage` only reads existing `VirtualMachineImage`s). Before any `DBInstance` can provision, the relevant baked image(s) (`database/internal/catalog/baked_images.go`) must already exist and be `Active` in the `default` namespace.

- Upload via Harvester's UI or `virtctl image-upload`; **Name** must exactly match the catalog's `ImageName` — a typo fails silently the same way a missing image does.
- Hit `timeout waiting for the datasource file processing begin`? A Rancher-proxying load balancer's upload size cap (hit at ~700MB) — upload directly against Harvester instead.
- **Not automated**: no publish location or `sourceType: download` generator exists yet — open item, tracked in Discussion #303.

## 8. Apply the Harvester Addon manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dbaas-system
---
apiVersion: harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: Addon
metadata:
  name: dbaas-operator
  namespace: dbaas-system
  labels:
    addon.harvesterhci.io/experimental: "true"
spec:
  enabled: true
  repo: ""   # required key, but must stay empty for an oci:// chart — see below
  chart: oci://<registry>/charts/dbaas-operator
  version: <X.Y.Z>
  valuesContent: |-
    {}
```
`repo` is schema-required but `helm repo add` (which the install job only runs when `repo` is non-empty) doesn't understand `oci://` — an explicit empty string satisfies the schema without breaking the OCI pull, which happens entirely through `chart`.

`valuesContent: {}` installs the chart defaults. **For a production install, set it as shown in [Production hardening](#production-hardening-reject-vm-password-login) instead.**

```sh
kubectl apply -f dbaas-operator-addon.yaml
```

## 9. Verify the install

```sh
kubectl get addon dbaas-operator -n dbaas-system -o jsonpath='{.status.status}{"\n"}'   # → AddonDeploySuccessful
kubectl get jobs -n dbaas-system                                                         # install Job (helm-delete-* on uninstall)
kubectl get pods -n dbaas-system                                                         # manager pod
kubectl get deployment dbaas-operator-controller-manager -n dbaas-system \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'                          # confirm the pushed image is running
```

## 10. Create a test `DBInstance`

Requires step 7 done, and a real `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (`kubectl get network-attachment-definitions -A`):

```yaml
apiVersion: dbaas.opencloud.wso2.com/v1alpha1
kind: DBInstance
metadata:
  name: dbaas-test-01
  namespace: default
spec:
  dbInstanceClass: db.t3.micro
  allocatedStorage: 5
  dbName: testdb
  masterUsername: dbadmin
  manageMasterUserPassword: true
  networkRef: <namespace>/<nad-name>
  running: true
```
```sh
kubectl apply -f dbinstance-test.yaml
kubectl get dbinstance dbaas-test-01 -n default -w
```
Not `Available`? `kubectl describe dbinstance dbaas-test-01 -n default` — the condition maps to a specific `internal/ensure/preflight.go` check (usually `OSImageNotFound`/`OSImageInvalid` from step 7, not a manifest problem).

**Definition of done:** `Addon` status `AddonDeploySuccessful` **+** manager pod `Running` with the expected image **+** a test `DBInstance` reaching `Available`. All three — a healthy `Addon` status alone doesn't prove a database can provision.

## Production hardening: reject VM password login

`spec.vmPassword` gives a VM console/SSH password login and is meant for development only. The operator setting `security.rejectVMPassword` (flag `--security.rejectVMPassword=true`) refuses it. **It defaults to off, so production installs should turn it on.**

- **When on:** a *new* `DBInstance` that sets `spec.vmPassword` is rejected (`Accepted=False`, reason `VMPasswordNotAllowed`, phase `incompatible-parameters`) and nothing is created. Instances whose VM already exists are never affected.
- **Enable it** through the Addon's `valuesContent` (step 8):

  ```yaml
    valuesContent: |-
      manager:
        args:
          - --operator.leaderElection.enabled=true
          - --observability.metrics.bindAddress=:8443
          - --security.rejectVMPassword=true
  ```

  A list override **replaces** the default `manager.args`, it does not merge. Repeat every flag from `values.yaml` (the first two are today's defaults), or leader election and metrics are silently lost. The kustomize path sets `"security": {"rejectVMPassword": true}` in the operator config instead; `DBAAS_SECURITY__REJECT_VM_PASSWORD=true` also works.
- **Check it is active:** `kubectl get deployment dbaas-operator-controller-manager -n dbaas-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].args}'` must list the flag.
- **Good to know:** new instances then have no console or SSH login through the operator (no password, no injected key). `vmPassword` is immutable, so an existing instance can only drop it by being recreated; take a `pg_dump` first.

## Upgrading an already-installed Addon

A version bump does **not** need disable/re-enable — Harvester's controller reacts to a `spec.version` change with a real `helm upgrade --install` in place, leaving CRDs and existing `DBInstance`s untouched.

1. Build + push the new image (`ghcr.io/wso2/dbaas-operator:<new-version>`).
2. Bump `Chart.yaml`'s `version`/`appVersion` together (chart's `values.yaml` tag `""` already tracks `appVersion`, no separate edit needed).
3. Package + push the new chart version (steps 3, 5).
4. `kubectl patch addon dbaas-operator -n dbaas-system --type merge -p '{"spec":{"version":"<new-version>"}}'`
5. Verify as in step 9, plus `kubectl get dbinstance -A` to confirm existing instances stayed `Available`.

During the rolling update, old and new manager pods may briefly overlap — this is exactly what leader election (`--operator.leaderElection.enabled=true` in `manager.args`, `values.yaml`) guards against.

## Uninstalling / rolling back

```sh
# 1. Disable first — real helm-uninstall, reversible
kubectl patch addon dbaas-operator -n dbaas-system --type merge -p '{"spec":{"enabled":false}}'
# 2. Only if you want the Addon object gone too (allowed — experimental label)
kubectl delete addon dbaas-operator -n dbaas-system
```
`values.yaml`'s `crd.keep: true` (`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`) stops the `DBInstance` CRD being deleted by either step — it has no effect on normal `helm upgrade` schema changes, which still apply in place. Existing `DBInstance`s (and their VMs/data) are untouched regardless — operator uninstall is not database deletion.

## Publishing a real release

Once WSO2 registry access exists:

1. Bump `Chart.yaml`'s `version`/`appVersion` and the image tag together (`0.1.x` lockstep policy, Discussion #303 §"Versioning").
2. `git tag database/vX.Y.Z && git push origin database/vX.Y.Z`
3. Run steps 3–5 against `ghcr.io/wso2/...`.
4. Create a GitHub Release for that tag; attach the `.tgz` and (if generated) `dist/install.yaml` as **release assets** — `gh release upload database/vX.Y.Z dbaas-operator-<X.Y.Z>.tgz dist/install.yaml`. Neither is ever committed (same pattern cert-manager uses for `cert-manager.yaml`).
5. Reference the exact digests in the release notes, as Discussion #303's "Reproducibility record" does.

## Known gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spec.repo: Required value` | Harvester's CRD schema requires the `repo` key present | Set `repo: ""` explicitly (step 8) |
| `DBInstance` phase `incompatible-parameters` immediately | `Accepted=False` from `preflight.go` — check `.status.conditions` | Usually `OSImageNotFound`/`OSImageInvalid` (step 7), not a manifest problem |
| `DBInstance` phase `incompatible-parameters`, `Accepted` reason `VMPasswordNotAllowed` | The operator runs with `security.rejectVMPassword=true` and the manifest sets `spec.vmPassword` | Remove `spec.vmPassword` and recreate the `DBInstance`; or, on a dev install only, turn the setting off (see [Production hardening](#production-hardening-reject-vm-password-login)) |
| UI image upload times out at 60s with a Longhorn datasource error | Rancher's proxying load balancer has an upload size cap (~700MB) | Upload directly against Harvester, bypassing the proxy |
