# dbaas

**A Kubernetes operator for managed PostgreSQL on Harvester HCI / KubeVirt.**

One `DBInstance` custom resource maps to one VM with persistent storage,
SSL-only PostgreSQL, and tenant-facing credentials. `kubectl apply` to a working `psql` connection in
about 3 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A [**Harvester HCI**](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/tree/v1.7) cluster (tested on 1.7.1 / RKE2 v1.34.3)
- A Multus **NetworkAttachmentDefinition** for the VM's data network already
  created on the cluster — the controller only attaches to `spec.networkRef`,
  it never creates networks.
- [**Rancher Monitoring**](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/monitoring/harvester-monitoring)
  enabled on the cluster (it bundles the Prometheus Operator and the
  `ServiceMonitor` CRD) — per-instance monitoring resources are created
  unconditionally.
- `kubectl`, and a `KUBECONFIG` pointed at the Harvester cluster.
- To build from source: **Go 1.25+**, `make`, and `docker buildx` for
  cross-building the manager image.

## Quickstart

```sh
# From this directory, with kubectl + docker buildx pointed at your Harvester kubeconfig:
make docker-buildx IMG=<registry>/<name>:<tag>
KUBECONFIG=<harvester-kubeconfig> make install
KUBECONFIG=<harvester-kubeconfig> make deploy IMG=<registry>/<name>:<tag>

kubectl apply -f config/samples/dbaas_v1alpha1_dbinstance.yaml
kubectl get dbi -A -w
```

~3 minutes from `apply` to `phase: available` on a stock Ubuntu cloud image;
actual time depends on image pull and first-boot package-install speed.

The above is the internal/team install path (kustomize + `make deploy`). For
installing via Helm and a Harvester `Addon` instead — the path a real
Rancher/Harvester administrator would use — see [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md).

## Operator configuration

The operator loads its typed JSON configuration through
[`nil-go/konf`](https://github.com/nil-go/konf). The default deployment does
not require a ConfigMap: it starts with built-in defaults and the flags in the
Deployment manifest.

Configuration precedence, from lowest to highest, is:

```text
built-in defaults < configuration file < environment variables < explicit flags
```

Environment variables use the `DBAAS_` prefix and `__` between hierarchy
segments, for example
`DBAAS_CONTROLLER__MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES=4`. Flags use canonical dotted
paths, for example `--controller.maxConcurrentReconciles=4`.

Platform policy switches live under `security`. For example `security.rejectVMPassword` (default off) refuses
`spec.vmPassword`, which is for development only; see [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md#production-hardening-reject-vm-password-login).

Configuration changes require an operator Pod restart or Deployment rollout;
live reload and cloud-backed providers are not enabled in the first release.

An optional Kustomize overlay creates a `dbaas-operator-config` ConfigMap,
mounts its `config.json` key inside the controller Pod at
`/etc/dbaas/config.json`. The operator automatically loads that fixed path
when the file exists:

```sh
kubectl create namespace dbaas-system
kubectl apply -k config/overlays/operator-config
```

Edit
[`config/overlays/operator-config/operator_config.yaml`](config/overlays/operator-config/operator_config.yaml)
before applying the overlay. The regular `make deploy` path continues to use
`config/default`, creates the standard `dbaas-system` namespace automatically,
and does not create or mount this ConfigMap.

The installation namespace is Kubernetes deployment metadata, so it is not
part of `config.json`. It is defined once by `namespace` in
`config/overlays/operator-config/kustomization.yaml`. For example, to install
in `dbaas-system-v2`, change that one field, create the namespace, and apply
the same overlay:

```sh
kubectl create namespace dbaas-system-v2
kubectl apply -k config/overlays/operator-config
```

Kustomize assigns the selected namespace to every namespaced resource,
including the ConfigMap, Deployment, ServiceAccount, Service, Roles, and
RoleBindings. The Deployment injects its namespace into `POD_NAMESPACE`
through the Downward API, and the operator uses that value for its
controller-private Secrets. Reusable manifests do not create a fixed
Namespace resource; the target namespace must exist before applying the
configuration overlay. The separate `config/default` installation wrapper
does include the standard `dbaas-system` Namespace for a one-command default
installation.

## What it provisions

Each `DBInstance` (`dbaas.opencloud.wso2.com/v1alpha1`, namespaced) creates:

| Resource | Details |
| --- | --- |
| VM (KubeVirt) | One data-net NIC bridged onto the Multus NAD in `spec.networkRef` (must already exist). DHCP by default, or `spec.staticNetwork` for VLANs without one. Address published as `status.endpoint.address`. |
| PostgreSQL version | `spec.engineVersion` (immutable) is resolved against the target baked image's supported major versions; `bootstrap.sh` drops the OS-default cluster and creates one on the requested version instead. Defaults to that baked image's `DefaultEngineVersion` when unset. |
| `pg-<name>-credentials` (tenant Secret) | `admin_user` / `admin_password` only. The password is generated, or copied from a Secret of your own (see [Choosing the master password](#choosing-the-master-password)). |
| `pg-<name>-connect` (tenant Secret) | `host`, `port`, `dbname`, `jdbcUrl`, `sslmode`, `ca.crt` — no password material. |
| TLS | Per-instance CA + server cert. Private key material lives in a controller-private Secret in the operator namespace, never exposed to tenants. `pg_hba.conf` enforces `hostssl … scram-sha-256` only; the master role gets `CREATEDB`/`CREATEROLE` but not `SUPERUSER`. |
| Monitoring | Per-instance Prometheus `Service` + `ServiceMonitor` (exporter install is pending). |

`dbName` and `masterUsername` are validated against PostgreSQL identifier
rules (`^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_$]{0,62}$`) at apply time, so invalid names are
rejected up front instead of failing later inside cloud-init.

## Choosing the master password

By default the operator generates the master password. To use one of your own, create a Secret of type
`dbaas.opencloud.wso2.com/master-password` in the instance's namespace and reference it:

```yaml
spec:
  credentials:
    passwordSource:
      secretRef: {name: orders-db-password, key: password}
```

The operator reads your Secret once and keeps its own copy for retries and repave; editing or deleting your Secret
later does not change the database, and your Secret is never deleted by DBaaS. The setting is fixed at creation.
Either way, the password the database uses is in `pg-<name>-credentials`.

A full example is in
[`config/samples/dbaas_v1alpha1_dbinstance_byo_password.yaml`](config/samples/dbaas_v1alpha1_dbinstance_byo_password.yaml).
The rules, status conditions, what teardown removes and the lost-password runbook are in
[`CREDENTIALS.md`](./CREDENTIALS.md).

## How it works

- **Bounded ensure-step reconciler** — every reconcile walks the same fixed,
  ordered chain of steps, each re-observing real cluster/provider state , and stopping at the first step
  that isn't satisfied. It's idempotent and crash-safe via
  `status.resources`. Conditions are the *reported outcome* of a pass.

- **REST gateway** — a thin HTTP layer over the CRD (list/create/get/modify/
  delete/start/stop). Every request forwards the caller's bearer token, so
  the K8s API server enforces the same authn/RBAC/audit path as `kubectl` —
  there's no separate DBaaS login.
- **RBAC-native access control** — the scaffolded `dbinstance-admin/editor/
  viewer` ClusterRoles aggregate into the built-in `admin`/`edit`/`view`
  roles, so a Rancher project role (or any binding to those) is all a tenant
  needs.

## Not yet implemented

The CRD schema is broader than the implementation. These fields are
reserved for forward compatibility, but **the reconciler does not act on
them today**:

| Field | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `manageMasterUserPassword`, `masterUserPasswordRef` | Ignored; the controller generates a random admin password unless `spec.credentials` is set. Use `spec.credentials` for a password of your own; the API rejects combining it with these two. |
| `s3BackupConfig`, `backupRetentionPeriod`, `preferredBackupWindow` | Recorded but no pgBackRest install, schedule, or retention runs. |
| `multiAZ` | No Patroni / HA standby is created. |
| `dbParameterGroupRef` | No `DBParameterGroup` CRD exists in this module. |
| `tags` | Not propagated to child resource labels / annotations / dashboards. |
| `status.readReplicas` | Not populated — read replicas and `multiAZ` aren't implemented. |

Each limitation is also called out in the field's godoc (`kubectl explain
dbi.spec.<field>`). The schema shape is deliberately stable so manifests
written today keep working as these land.

## Build / test / develop

```sh
make manifests generate fmt vet build   # regenerate CRD + DeepCopy, build manager
make test                               # envtest-backed unit tests
make docker-buildx IMG=...              # cross-build linux/amd64, push
make install                            # apply CRD using current kubeconfig
make deploy IMG=...                     # apply manager + RBAC
make undeploy && make uninstall         # tear it all down
```
